# **powerplant-coding-challenge**

## About this Repository

This repository provides a solution to the coding challenge described in the official repository:

ðŸ”— [gem-spaas/powerplant-coding-challenge](https://github.com/gem-spaas/powerplant-coding-challenge)

The goal of the challenge is to simulate the calculation of an optimal power production plan, which determines how much power each plant should produce based on a given load. The main factors considered are:

- Fuel costs (e.g., gas, kerosine),
- Minimum (Pmin) and maximum (Pmax) generation capacities of each plant.

# Production Plan API

A RESTful API built with FastAPI that generates optimal electricity production plans using the merit order principle. It considers power demand, fuel costs, and plant constraints (`pmin`, `pmax`) to allocate production efficiently and cost-effectively.

The project follows a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns: API (routers), data validation (Pydantic models), and business logic (services). Core logic is encapsulated in the `ProductionPlanCalculator` service, which applies a step-by-step heuristic based on plant costs. Design patterns like Service and simplified MVC ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability. While the current implementation handles key constraints well, thereâ€™s room for improvement in allocation precision for edge cases.

## Architecture

Below is the proposed architecture designed to address the problem outlined in the API implementation.

![Architecture Diagram](static/images/architecture.png)

## Features

- Compute optimized production plans based on input constraints and fuel prices.
- Supports multiple plant types: `gasfired`, `turbojet`, and `windturbine`.
- Input validation with **Pydantic** models.
- Interactive API documentation via **Swagger UI**.

## Functional Requirements

- The API must accept a POST request with the following input:
  - A required load (in MW) to be distributed among the available power plants.
  - A list of power plants with their characteristics (`name`, `type`, `efficiency`, `pmin`, `pmax`).
  - Current fuel prices (gas, kerosine, COâ‚‚ cost, wind availability).
  
- The system must return a list of power production values per plant such that:
  - The total production equals the required load (within a small tolerance).
  - Each plant respects its individual constraints (`pmin`, `pmax`).
  - The solution is cost-optimal, prioritizing the cheapest plants (merit order).

- The algorithm must be able to:
  - Allocate power to wind turbines with zero cost first.
  - Use gas-fired or turbojet plants based on fuel cost and efficiency.
  - Handle edge cases where the load cannot be covered respecting all constraints.

> ![Imagen_api_swagger](static/images/api.png)

## Usage

Send a POST request to `/production_plan` with a JSON payload containing::

- `load`: Required power load (MWh).
- `fuels`: Object with fuel prices and wind percentage.
- `powerplants`: List of available plants and their characteristics.

Example payloads can be found in the `example_payloads` directory.

To calculate the production plan, send a POST request to the `/production_plan` endpoint with the JSON payload.

The API will return a JSON response with the name and assigned power for each plant.

## Input

The API accepts a JSON payload with the following fields:

- `load`: Total load in MWh per hour.
- `fuels`: Fuel prices and wind availability.
- `powerplants`: List of power plant data available.

Example payloads can be found in the `example_payloads` directory.

Example Input:

```json
{
  "load": 910,                    # Total load in MWh per hour
  "fuels": {                      # Fuel prices and wind availability
    "gas(euro/MWh)": 13.4,        # Gas price in â‚¬/MWh
    "kerosine(euro/MWh)": 50.8,   # Kerosine price in â‚¬/MWh
    "co2(euro/ton)": 20,          # CO2 emission price in â‚¬/ton
    "wind(%)": 60                 # Wind availability percentage (0-100)
  },
  "powerplants": [                # List of power plant data available
    {
      "name": "gasfiredbig1",     # Name of the powerplant
      "type": "gasfired",         # Type of power plant (gasfired, turbojet, windturbine)
      "efficiency": 0.54,         # Efficiency of the plant
      "pmin": 100,                # Minimum power output in MW
      "pmax": 460                 # Maximum power output in MW
    },
    {
      "name": "tj1",              
      "type": "turbojet",
      "efficiency": 0.3,
      "pmin": 0,
      "pmax": 200
    },
    {
      "name": "windpark1",        
      "type": "windturbine",
      "efficiency": 1,
      "pmin": 0,
      "pmax": 250
    }
  ]
}

```

## Output

The API will return a JSON response with the name and assigned power for each plant. The output will be sorted by cost (lowest to highest) and available power (highest to lowest).

Example output:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "windpark1",
    "p": 250.0
  },
  {
    "name": "gasfiredbig1",
    "p": 460.0
  },
  {
    "name": "tj1",
    "p": 200.0
  }
]
```
## Stop & remove the container

To stop and remove the container, run the following command:
```bash
docker rm -f powerplant_app          # Force removal
docker rmi hagr27/powerplant_app:v1  # Remove image

# Validate that the container and image are no longer present
docker ps -a | grep powerplant_app          # Check if container is still running
docker images | grep hagr27/powerplant_app  # Check if image is still present
```

## Testing

The following section presents the tests conducted using **pytest**.

### Integration Tests

Integration tests are implemented using the **FastAPI** framework. The tests are located in the `tests` directory and are grouped by functionality. For example, the `test_production_plan.py` file contains tests for the `/production_plan` endpoint, which calculates the optimal production plan based on the provided input, you need stay in the root directory of the project `/powerplant-coding-challenge`.

To run the integration tests, execute the following command:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -v
```

![test_api](static/images/test_api.png)

### Test Coverage

To measure the test coverage of the codebase, the following command can be used:

```bash
pytest --cov=app --cov-report=html
```

This command generates an HTML report that shows the coverage of the codebase. The report can be accessed at `htmlcov/index.html`.
